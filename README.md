# ruletti64
Roulette-game for Commodore 64

I wrote this game for Commodore64 in 1987 and the Finnish computer magazine MikroBitti published its source code listing in 1988 (number 5/1988)

ruletti.prg is the commodore binary file that can be executed in some emulator.

ruletti.txt is ascii version for reading and inspecting.
